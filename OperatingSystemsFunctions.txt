User Interface
Operating systems provide a user interface so that users can input data or instructions and displays data and instructions on the screen.
User interfaces can be graphical or command-line.
Most users who are accesing their devices for personal or business purposes use a graphical user interface.
Users who need more control over relatively small details are more likely to use a command-line interface.
I first leared the language BASIC in the 7th grade. BASIC is a command-line interface.
